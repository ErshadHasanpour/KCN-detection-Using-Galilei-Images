# KCN detection Using Galilei Images
This study utilized a cross-sectional approach to analyze a collection of corneal images from 3538 eyes. Among these eyes, 1872 were identified as having keratoconus, while 1666 were classified as healthy. The images were sourced from the Iranian National Registry for Keratoconus (KCNRegÂ®) and were obtained from recorded data. Four types of corneal maps, including Posterior Elevation Best-fit Toric Aspheric (BFTA), Anterior Elevation BFTA, Anterior Instantaneous Curvature, and Pachymetry maps provided by Galileo Corneal Tomography, were examined. The analysis encompassed two types of data: image data presented in the form of four comma-separated value (CSV)-driven maps, and numerical data represented by 14 indices. To differentiate between keratoconus and healthy eyes, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed for the analysis of the corneal images. The architecture of the CNN model is illustrated below.

This research makes several notable contributions to the existing literature, which can be summarized as follows:
1.	It utilized a substantial dataset obtained from the Galileo analyzer, ensuring a large sample size for analysis.
2.	The study introduced standardized color-coded maps, providing a consistent and easily interpretable visual representation.
3.	It integrated indices derived from the Galileo analyzer, expanding the range of quantitative data used in the analysis.
4.	The study employed four advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), each specifically designed for analyzing one of the four maps.
5.	A three-stage training approach was implemented, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the CNN models utilized in the study.
